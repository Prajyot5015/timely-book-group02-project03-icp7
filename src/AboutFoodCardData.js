Use preservation methods like drying, vacuum packing, or canning for long-term storage.Removing moisture and oxygen prevents bacterial growth . Deprive harmful microorganisms of oxygen by using vacuum-sealed containers.Extend the shelf life of food by reducing oxidation",
        heading3:" To identifying food spoilage",
        description3:"Slime: If your deli meats or leftover roasts have a sheen or feel soggy, they are past their prime. Mold is usually a pretty obvious sign of spoilage, making it easy to tell if food is spoiled. Keep an eye out for any visible mold growth. Changes in appearance, such as unusual colors, can indicate spoilage. Foul or off-putting smells are a clear sign that something has gone bad. If the texture of food feels different (e.g., sliminess), it might be spoiled. In frozen foods, ice crystal growth or package damage can affect quality. If eggs float in water, they may be old and not fresh. Bulging lids or unsealed jars could indicate spoilage or the presence of pathogens.Remember to trust your senses and use these signs to avoid consuming spoiled food.
